gitbash and github
--- go to local porject directory
--- open gitbash and run $ git init
--- then run $git add.
--- $ git remote -v to check the repository
--- $ if not ok then remove it by $git remote rm origin
--- and add new by $git remote add origin https://github.com/sadikul1500/myRepo.git
--- go to main branch by $ git branch -M main
--- commit by $git commit -m 'write something'
--- finally push by $git push -u origin main

if no errors then done!!!!!!! 
if error found like this -
	hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
	hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
	hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
	hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
	hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
	
then -
--- $ git fetch origin main:tmp
--- $ git rebase tmp
--- $ git push origin HEAD:main
--- $ git branch -D tmp
